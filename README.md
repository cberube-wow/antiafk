# antiafk
Simple Python script to avoid getting booted.

**For educational/personal use only.**

# How it works
- Install the latest [Python version](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install the following packages by entering these commands in your command prompt:
  - `pip install keyboard`
  - `pip install inputimeout`
- Run the script with `python antiafk.py`.
- Your character will now jump at random intervals if "Space" is bound to "Jump".
- Enjoy no deserter (you will still get reported if you're obvious).
